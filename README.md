# ONMMY AI Project

Welcome to the ONMMY AI project repository!  
This project is dedicated to developing advanced AI models and tools to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence.

## Project Overview

ONMMY aims to provide scalable, modular, and extensible AI solutions with clean code and robust architecture. Our initial focus includes CNN and Transformer-based models, with ongoing development to expand capabilities.

## Repository Structure

- `config/` — Configuration files for training and models  
- `data/` — Data processing and dataset utilities  
- `models/` — AI model implementations (CNN, Transformer, etc.)  
- `src/` — Scripts for training, evaluation, prediction, and logging  
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and visualization  
- `tests/` — Unit tests for quality assurance  

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

`git clone https://github.com/onmmy-ai/ONMMY.git`

`cd ONMMY`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Alternatively, install via setup.py:
`pip install setup.py`

## Usage

# Train the Model
`python src/train.py`

# Evaluate the Model
